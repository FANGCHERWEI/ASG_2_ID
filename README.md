# iTrack

iTrack is a money tracker and helps users manage their spending. Users can track and categorise their expenses and income, and view an analysis of their spending through intuitive charts. iTrack makes use of an api called the firebase. The firebase is an api that allows users to have the ability to sync, store and edit data in realtime. Using the "Spark plan"
in Google's firebase, I was able to use the firebase api for free but was limited to quotas for Database, Firestore, storage, Functions, Phone, Auth, Hosting and Test Lab. On the home page of iTrack, you are given the option to Login or SignUP. If you scroll down, you can see a short summary on what iTrack is. A simple and easy to use app that tracks all your expenses and income. Analyses your spending in intuitive charts and graphs!

Now, I can start breaking down how iTrack works. Firstly, after signing up and logging into iTrack, you are presented with the home page which is essentially the "Spending" page.
This page shows you 8 categories. These categories are, Food, Transport, Bills, Home, Entertainment, Salary, Sales and Gift. These 8 categories basically sum up what most of use interact with these days when it comes to money. So how the website works is that you can click the bottom right of the screen on "NEW SPENDING", and it will bring up this pop up sign which provides you with various blanks to fill in. The first blank to fil in is the Date, which is in the format DD-MM-YYYY (Day,Months,Years). The second blank is the Amount, this blank is for you to fill up how much money you have used or received and only integers are allowed to be input. The third blank is the Category, the following categories will be listed in the order of gift, salary, transport, home,  bills, sales, entertainment and food. Depending on what you used your money on, you can select the appropriate category. Lastly, There is a Note blank, this blank is for you to give a name or a description of what you have spent the money on so you can go back and check on your spendings. After adding whatever you have done for the month, you can edit your spendings as you like. After using the website for a while, you can start to use the website more efficiently by using the "Analytics" page. The Analytics page helps break down your spendings for you and shows you how much you have spent overall. It firstly starts off with your income, then your expenses, and finally subtracts your expenses from your income and shows your balance on whether you have either increased in money or decreased. The goal is to always be at a postive balance and try to increase that amount so you can increase your saving rate. At the bottom of the Analytics page, you can see a pie chart that displays your spendings and on the right the total spendings. You can also navigate to which month you want to see your spendings on. Lastly, The profile page, here you can just change your name, I have yet to add a change password option yet though. This is iTrack!

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## Design Process
 
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
